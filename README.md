# Derivatives Risk Management Toolkit

## Introduction

This project offers a comprehensive toolkit for managing the risk associated with derivative products, including vanilla options (calls and puts) and more complex option strategies such as straddles and strangles. The goal is to provide users with the means to understand and hedge their positions effectively. The toolkit includes functionalities for calculating theoretical Value at Risk (VaR), Monte Carlo VaR, and Cornish-Fisher VaR, as well as computing key Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Speed, Vega, etc.) for risk assessment and management.

## Features

- **Theoretical VaR Calculation**: Compute VaR using traditional models to estimate potential losses.  
- **Monte Carlo VaR Simulation**: Utilize Monte Carlo simulations for more accurate risk estimations under various market conditions.  
- **Cornish-Fisher VaR Calculation**: Implement the Cornish-Fisher expansion to adjust VaR calculations for skewness and kurtosis in return distributions.  
- **Greeks Calculation**: Calculate key Greeks including Delta, Gamma, Speed, Vega, and others to assess the sensitivity of option prices to various factors.  
- **Risk Hedging Strategies**: Learn and apply strategies to hedge against market movements effectively.
